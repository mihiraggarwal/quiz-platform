        <li>There are a total of 15 questions, all fill in the blanks.</li>
        <li>The spacing and letter casing don't matter.<br>
        For example, 'Foo Bar' and 'foobar' will be the same</li>
        <li>A <span>maximum of 30 seconds</span> will be given for each question. Any answer after that will be marked incorrect. A timer is present at the top of the screen for your reference. The questions will not change automatically, therefore, itâ€™s your job to press the submit button well within the time limit.</li>
        <li>For each correct answer, you will get <span>100 - (number of seconds * 2)</span> points.<br>
        For example, if Timothy answers the first question correct in 12 seconds, he will receive 100 - 12*2 i.e. 76 points for it.</li>
        <li>For each incorrect answer, your points will be <span>negated by the time taken</span> on that particular question in seconds.<br>
        For example, if Timothy answers the second question incorrect in 17 seconds, his total score will be negated by 17 points.<br>
        So after two questions, Timothy's final score would be 76-17 i.e. 59 points.</li>
        <li><span>Switching tabs/windows, reloading, minimising, or changing the URL</span> is not permitted. Doing so will automatically mark that question as incorrect.</li>
        <li>Needless to say, any evidence found of cheating or partnering will lead to immediate disqualification.</li>
