    <h1 id="rules_h1">Rules</h1>
    <ul id="rules">
        <li>There are a total of 15 questions, all fill in the blanks.</li>
        <li>The spacing and letter casing don't matter.<br>
        For example, 'Foo Bar' and 'foobar' will be the same</li>
        <li>The answers will only be alphanumerical. Don't put in any symbols in the answer.</li>
        <li>The top 4 participants will qualify for the final round.</li>
        <li>A maximum of 30 seconds will be given for each question. Any answer after that will be marked incorrect. A timer is present at the top of the screen for your reference. The questions will not change automatically, therefore, it’s your job to press the submit button well within the time limit.</li>
        <li>For each correct answer, you will get 100 - (number of seconds**2) points.<br>
        For example, if James answers the first question correct in 12 seconds, he will receive 100 - 12*2 i.e. 76 points for it.</li>
        <li>For each incorrect answer, your points will be negated by the time taken on that particular question in seconds. For example, if James answers the second question incorrect in 17 seconds, his total score will be negated by 17 points.</li>
        <li>So after two questions, James' final score would be 76-17 i.e. 59 points.</li>
        <li>Switching tabs/windows, reloading, minimising, or changing the current URL is not permitted. Doing so will automatically mark that question as incorrect.</li>
        <li>Needless to say, any evidence found of cheating or partnering will lead to immediate disqualification.</li>
